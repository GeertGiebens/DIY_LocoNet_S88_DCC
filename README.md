# LocoNet Input/Output or DCC Output Device with 16 ports

Devices that can read 16 inputs or switch 16 outputs. The Data can be placed or read on LocoNet. Addressing is kept very simple with dip switches. The PCB is designed in such a way that extensions are possible for current detection at input devices. There are several options on PCB for various connection options. The software is written for PIC micro controllers in assembler.
