# LocoNet or DCC Input- Output Device with 16 ports
Devices that can read or switch 16 inputs or 16 outputs. The Data can be placed or read on LocoNet (also reading from DCC is possible for devices with only outputs). Addressing is kept very simple with dip switches. The PCB is designed in such a way that extensions are possible for current detection at input devices. There are several options on PCB for various connection options. The software is written for PIC micro controllers in assembler.
