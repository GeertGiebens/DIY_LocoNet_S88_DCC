## DIY LocoNet circuits for 16 inputs or 16 outputs:

- DIY: these circuits can be copied yourself with a word of explanation.

- Components: Not too many components are used on each circuit. Mostly standard electronic components are used (outside the PIC microcontroller).

- Applications and connections: Several types of applications are possible. However, it is limited to the same type of application per circuit. There are various possibilities of connections on the PCBs for peripheral equipment. (current detection; mass detection; coils; lights and LEDs; relay cards etc ...)

- Setting: No external programming device such as a PC or digital central unit required to set the circuit. Application and addressing can be easily set with a few DIP switches.

- Indication LEDs (optional): There are some indication LEDs available to monitor the proper functioning of the circuit and peripherals (LocoNet bus).

- Replacement: A circuit can be easily and quickly replaced by another circuit for the same application and addressing by adopting the position of the DIP switches.

- Flat cable: The possibility is provided to make maximum use of flat cable connections. Flat cable connections are easily (and quickly) self-made without screws or soldering. Flat cable connections can be replaced quickly and flat cables provide an overview of the wiring train table.

- LocoNet connection: The circuits can also be connected in series via pin headers whereby LocoNet signals must at least run over cables.

- Cost price: And lastly, DIY is cheap!
