### Mass detection connection:

- Alternately, the feedback signal and Mass are connected via the ribbon cable. In principle, only 1 Mass needs to be connected between the printed circuit board and the Mass digital central. You can also run the other Mass connections parallel to the feedback point and cut them off there. Because there is a Mass between each feedback signal, mutual interference is kept to a minimum. (see example below)
