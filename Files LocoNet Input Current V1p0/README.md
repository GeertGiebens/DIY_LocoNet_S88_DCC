### Mass detection connection:

- Alternatively, the feedback signal and mass are connected via the ribbon cable. In principle, only 1 mass needs to be connected to the rails. You can also run the other mass connections parallel to the feedback point and cut them off there. Since there is a mass between each feedback signal, mutual interference is kept to a minimum.  (see example below)
